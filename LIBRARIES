libmc--c depends on several libraries.  I've only built libmc--c using MinGW.

DevIL 1.7.8
    http://openil.sourceforge.net/
SFML 1.6
    http://www.sfml-dev.org/
GCC 4.5.0 library and standard C++ library
    http://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html

See https://sites.google.com/site/axusdev/builds/buildgcc/ for instructions on
obtaining MinGW source and building libgcc and libstdc++ (as required by LGPL!)
    
A program using libmc--c requires these shared libraries:
ILU.dll
ILUT.dll
SFML-system.dll
SFML-graphics.dll
SFML-window.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libstdc++-6.dll

If rebuilding libmc--c, these headers are required on the INCLUDE path:
<SFML/Graphics.hpp>
<IL/il.h>
<IL/ilu.h>
<iostream>
<string>
<iomanip>
<fstream>
<vector>
