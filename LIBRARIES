libmc--c depends on several libraries.  I've only built libmc--c using MinGW.

C++ compiler supporting STL, C++0x
    http://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html
DevIL 1.7.8
    http://openil.sourceforge.net/
GLEW 1.5.7
    http://glew.sourceforge.net/
Zlib 1.2.5
    http://zlib.net/zlib125-dll.zip
    http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
    
See https://sites.google.com/site/axusdev/builds/buildgcc/ for instructions on
obtaining MinGW source and building libgcc and libstdc++ (as required by LGPL!)

vLK has built an earlier version of libmc--c using MSVC, but he had to create a
new project.  If you're as smart as him, it should be easy ;p


A program using libmc--c and MinGW requires these shared libraries:
ILU.dll
ILUT.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
zlib1.dll


If rebuilding libmc--c with MinGW, these headers are required on INCLUDE path:
<IL/il.h>
<IL/ilu.h>
<zlib.h>
<iostream>
<string>
<iomanip>
<fstream>
<vector>
<map>
<cstdlib>
<cstdint>


*SFML*
I've only tested libmc--c with SFML as the OpenGL framework, so it might be
required.

SFML 1.6
    http://www.sfml-dev.org/

You would need these DLLs:
SFML-system.dll
SFML-graphics.dll
SFML-window.dll

You would need to include this:
<SFML/Graphics.hpp>
